# 🛠️ Introduction

This test plan defines the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for the automation testing of the Luni Interface website using Cypress and the Page Object Model (POM). The automation framework will validate core functionalities, navigation, responsiveness, and user interactions to ensure a seamless user experience.

# 🎯 Objectives

✅ Ensure all key functionalities of the Luni Interface website work as expected.
✅ Validate navigation flows and redirections.
✅ Test responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
✅ Verify interactive elements and UI components.
✅ Identify and report bugs effectively.


# 📌 Scope

🚀 Homepage Navigation
🔐 Login/Signup🎛 Interactive Components
🛒 Add to Cart & Checkout Process
📱 Responsiveness & Layout
📝 Content Validation
🔗 Footer Links


# 📝 Testable Features

Homepage Navigation: Validate header & footer navigation links.


Login/Signup: Test redirection from CTA buttons, error handling, and success cases.


Interactive Components: Verify functionality of sliders, toggles, and dynamic UI components.


Add to Cart & Checkout: Validate error messages and success messages after correct submissions.


Responsiveness & Layout: Ensure proper display across devices.


Content Validation: Verify static and dynamic content accuracy.


Footer Links: Check redirection to relevant pages.

# ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

## Risk                                              Mitigation Strategy

Cypress compatibility issues :         Use latest stable versions, cross-browser testing

Dynamic UI changes :                   Implement flexible locators and update tests accordingly

Test flakiness :                       Use retry mechanisms and proper wait strategies

Resource availability:                 Plan testing activities in advance, allocate tasks efficiently

🚀 By following this test plan, we aim to ensure a high-quality user experience on the Luni Interface website through efficient and reliable test automation. ✅
