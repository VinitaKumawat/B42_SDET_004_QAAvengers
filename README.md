# B42_SDET_004_QAAvengers
## Introduction
This test plan aims to define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for
the automation testing of the Luni Interface website using Cypress and the
Page Object Model (POM). The test automation framework will validate core
functionalities, navigation, responsiveness, and user interactions.

## Objectives

• Ensure all key functionalities of the Luni Interface website work as
expected.

• Validate navigation flows and redirections.

• Test responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet,
mobile).

• Verify interactive elements and UI components.

• Identify and report bugs effectively.

## Scope

•Homepage Navigation

• Login/Signup

• Interactive Components

• Add to Cart & Checkout Process

• Responsiveness and Layout

• Content Validation

• Footer Links

## Testable Features

•Homepage Navigation: Validate header & footer navigation links

•Login/Signup: Test redirection from CTA buttons, error handling, and success cases

•Interactive Components: Verify functionality of sliders, toggles, and dynamic UI components

•Add to Cart & Checkout: Validate error messages and success messages after correct submissions

•Responsiveness & Layout: Ensure proper display across devices

•Content Validation: Verify static and dynamic content accuracy

•Footer Links: Check redirection to relevant pages

## Testing Approach

• Cypress will be used as the test automation tool.

• The Page Object Model (POM) will be implemented for maintainability and reusability.

• Tests will be executed via the Cypress CLI and GUI.

• Assertions will be applied to validate expected outcomes.

• Automated tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Test Deliverables

• Test Scenarios and Test Cases

• Test Scripts (Cypress with POM)

• Bug Reports

• Summary Report

• Mind Map for Test Flow Visualization

## Entry and Exit Criteria

## Entry Criteria:
• The test environment setup is complete.

• All necessary test data is available.

• The application under test is stable.
## Exit Criteria:
• All planned test cases are executed.

• Major defects are fixed and retested.

• The test summary
## Tools
• Test Automation Tool: Cypress

• Programming Language: JavaScript

• Framework: Mocha & Chai (within Cypress)

• Defect Tracking: Jira or similar tool

• CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions

## Risks & Mitigation
Risk                                     Mitigation Strategy
Cypress compatibility issues:     Use the latest stable versions, cross-browser testing

Dynamic UI changes:          Implement flexible locators and update tests accordingly

Test flakiness:             Use retry mechanisms and proper wait strategies

Resource availability:      Plan testing activities in advance, and allocate tasks efficiently
